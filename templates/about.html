    This portal was developed by the <strong>E-Commerce App Team</strong> to improve efficiency and transparency 
    in our product update workflow. It provides authorized employees with quick, centralized access to 
    <strong>Manual Integration (MI) files</strong> that are now generated automatically.

  <p style="margin:0 8px 10px 8px">
    The system collects product data from our internal sources, prepares it in the correct MI format, and 
    uploads it to the Suppy dashboard. Every run is logged for visibility, and all generated files are 
    stored here for easy download and review.

    3. The file is uploaded to Suppy automatically.<br>
    4. A copy is stored in the “Files” section for employee access.<br>
    5. All activity is recorded in the “Overview” log.
